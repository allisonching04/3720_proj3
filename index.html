				Eating "fear foods" can produce intense anxiety for those with EDs, and to make light of that is to severely misunderstand what they're going through. Furthermore, reversing the effects of eating disorder weight loss is not as simple as “eating a hamburger.” Recovery often involves an entire re-learning of how to approach eating.

				While it often begins with wanting to take control of personal appearance, it is far more than an over-hyped diet for the sufferer and it frequently morphs into an obsessive-compulsive condition rooted much deeper than disquiet over a dress or pant size. Research is beginning to reveal stronger genetic tethers to the disorder (40%-50% of the risk factor) than was previously understood to exist. And while the disorder may come across as self-absorbed to casual observers, it is often the sufferer’s sincere desire to care for others to which therapists appeal during recovery treatment.

				It might seem like the anorexic person who is able to be so strict with their diet could put that same willpower to work in making themselves eat – but it doesn’t work that way. Neither does it help the binge eater to insist they need to try harder to diet. Eating disorder sufferers are not able to will themselves out of the dangerous food behavior. Their issues with food are compulsions resultant from things entirely separate and recovery requires addressing the emotional issues and physical complications that the disorder presents.

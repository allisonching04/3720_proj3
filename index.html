Research is beginning to reveal stronger genetic tethers to the disorder (40%-50% of the risk factor) than was previously understood to exist. And while the disorder may come across as self-absorbed to casual observers, it is often the sufferer’s sincere desire to care for others to which therapists appeal during recovery treatment.</div>
